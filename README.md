#Admin dashboard

This was a challenge as part of the odin project. 

You can see a live preview of the page [here](https://github.com/JoelSWarburton/admin-dashboard/deployments/github-pages)

This projects main aim was to use HTML and CSS to create a mock up of an admin dashboard
using css grids for the main sections layout. 
This page is <ins>_not_</ins> designed to be functional in any way. 

I spent a little bit of time making sure this page was reactive to screen size changes.
